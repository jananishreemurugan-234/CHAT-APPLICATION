# CHAT-APPLICATION

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: M.JANANI SHREE

INTERN ID:CTO4DZ1778

DOMAIN: FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

## TASK DESCRIPTION

## Overview  
This project is a **simple real-time chat application** built with **Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO**. The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate how real-time communication works on the web using WebSockets. Unlike traditional web applications where a page must be refreshed to update content, this app allows messages to be sent and received instantly between multiple clients.  

To keep the project simple and beginner-friendly, the application is designed so that if you open it in **two different tabs** (or browsers), you can type a message in one tab, and it will immediately appear in the other tab. This shows the power of WebSocket-based communication and how data is broadcast to all connected clients without delay.  

This project is ideal for learning the basics of **socket programming**, **client-server communication**, and **real-time event handling** in JavaScript.  

## Objectives  
The key objectives of this project are:  
- To demonstrate how to build a **real-time chat system** using **Socket.IO**.  
- To allow multiple browser tabs or devices to communicate with each other instantly.  
- To create a lightweight and minimal chat interface that focuses purely on message exchange.  
- To provide a foundation for extending the project into more advanced chat systems with features like usernames, rooms, or media sharing.  

## Features  
1. **Real-time Messaging** – Messages typed in one tab are instantly visible in another tab.  
2. **WebSocket Communication** – Uses **Socket.IO** for fast, event-driven messaging.  
3. **Simple User Interface** – A clean HTML/CSS layout with a text input and message display area.  
4. **Lightweight Project** – Easy to set up and run with minimal dependencies.  
5. **Cross-Tab/Device Support** – Works across multiple tabs or browsers on the same network.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Realtime Communication:** Socket.IO  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript  
- **Runtime Environment:** Runs locally on Node.js server (port 3000 by default)  

## Install dependencies:

npm install

## Start the server:

node server.js

## Open the app in your browser:

http://localhost:3000
Open the same link in two different tabs and try sending a message. You will see it appear in both tabs instantly! 

## Conclusion

This chat application is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the fundamentals of real-time communication on the web. By using Socket.IO, we establish a persistent connection between the server and clients, allowing data to be exchanged instantly without refreshing the page.

Although minimal in design, the app provides a strong foundation for building more complex real-time systems. Developers can expand it with authentication, chat rooms, message persistence, or even video calls. This makes it an excellent first step into the world of real-time web applications and a valuable addition to any developer’s portfolio.
